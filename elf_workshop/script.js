/* Build an elf workshop simulator that:
            1. Uses arrow functions for each production stage
            2. Manages scope for workshop sections
 
            Create functions for:
            - paintToy (arrow function)
            - assembleToy (arrow function)
            - qualityCheck (arrow function)
 
            Each function should:
            - Use block-scoped variables for tracking paint colors, parts, etc.
            - Keep track of successful vs failed toys
            */
